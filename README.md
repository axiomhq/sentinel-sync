The home of the Azure Sentinel => Axiom exporter tool. 

If you need to get your azure sentinel tables into axiom for long term storage and querying, this is how you do that.

There is a linked [Theory of Operation](./doc/theory_of_operation.md) document that describes how this tool works and is essential reading to deploy this tool as it requires some azure setup. 

After setting up this tool in your Azure cloud you should be a happy consumer of all your azure sentinel data, within Axiom.
